This is a conference proceedings talk, for when you give a talk at a conference that archives talks as publications. When the talk_type variable is set to "Conference proceedings talk", this talk will appear in the Talks page in /talks/, but it will not appear in the Talks section in the /cv/ page. The reason for this is that the conference proceedings talk should have a seprate publications .md file in the /_publications/ folder, which will go in the publications section. You can change this behavior by modifying the /_pages/cv.md file.
